        <h5>Description/Reflection:<h5>
            <p>This game was inspired by Destiny, the original open world shooter game. Our game is a game where you travel to other planets and hunt down enimies.
            For the shooting aspect of the game. We implemented a shoot and score system. It consits that when you shoot an enemy you gain points. You can die by having the 
            enemies shoot at you a select number of times. The randomness occurs on our market encoders plaza. For every "open" the user clicks a random item will be given to
            the player/user. We madet the game because we had an interest in the game as we had put hours in the original game. We just had to recreate an aspect of it somehow.
            The two successful parts in our project was the smooth animations of the sprites thorughout the game and our fluid design scheme. The two obatcles we had faced was making everything
            work the way it should smotthly such as animations and our timing of each sprite. If we had more time, we would make the game more fluid in timing as well as extra features on our
            game. One of the extra features would be more enemy variations on more planets as we only had two.</p>

            <p>The batch of scripts here, are the most significant as the make our first animations more fluently with one sprite and 420 animation frames!</p>
